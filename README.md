# skript-three-features
A list of features/ideas for skript three. This is more about what would be nice to have, not really what one actually can achieve with a reasonable amount of effort. It does not have to be compatible with previous versions of skript. It does not even have to be strictly about Minecraft, discussions about a more general skript-like language are more than welcome!

Please add an [issue](https://github.com/bi0qaw/skript-three-features/issues) if you have a feature/idea for skript three.
